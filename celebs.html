            <h3>Ashton Kutcher</h3>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post date: Dec 5, 2016.</h5>
            <p>The thing about Ashton Kutcher is that he was funny...yea was funny until That 70's show got to its fifth season and he became a cop. How is that supposed to make me laugh, some mediocre actor in a blue uniform 40 years ago. I am sick of hearing about Ashton this and Ashton that...</p>

            <p>That kid from Home Alone, whats his name Mukuly Kulkin or something like that. Whats his deal anyway...makes one movie about beating up a couple of burglers and then thinks he can go do drugs and look like someone who should have died 15 years ago. This is the problem with "hollywood", they get these kids all hopped up on the good life and then leave them out to die.</p>
